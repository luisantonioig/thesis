*** Mention some important bugs in history of smart contracts ($$)
- The DAO Attack ($50)
- King of the Ether Throne
- Multi-player Games
- Rubixi
- GovernMental
- Dynamic libraries
** Main Goal
To compare Smart Contracts Platforms to be able to recomend the best according with the purpose of the implementation

*** specific goals
- Implement Smart Contracts in different platforms
- Gather metrics
- Issue a trial
** How this thesis organized
- Background
- Methodology
- Experiment
- Results
- Discussion of the results
- Conclusion and Lessons Learned

* Background
** Loyalty programs
*** History
- Airlines' frequent fliers schemes 1981
- Hotel's rewards
- Banks
- Grocery Stores
*** Size of the industry
- Membership has reached 1.3 billions (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
- The average US household belongs to 12 loyalty programs (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
- Only 4.7 yield active participation
** Blockchain

*** History
- Bitcoin (2008) (Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system)
- Ethereum (2015)
- Fork: Ethereum and Ethereum Clasic (2016)
*** Consensus Algorithms
**** POW (Proof of Work)
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
**** POS (Proof of Stake)
**** Others
*** Smart Contracts
- Programming script inside the blockchain
- Executed autamatically
- Creation of DApps
*** Tokens
- Currencies created with Smart Contracts
- There are standars for creations of tokens like ERC-20
- Exist some exchanges (Waves)
- You can use wallets to save all your tokens
*** Decentralized applications
- Applications running inside the blockchain
- Distribuited
- Descentralized (This in red)
** Technologies
*** Bitcoin
*** Ethereum
*** Waves
*** Cardano
*** EOS
** Metrics
*** Quantitaive
- Cost
- Speed
- Halstead metrics
*** Qualititive
- Easy to develop
- Features
- Consensus algorithm
- Authentication methods

** Requirements Specification of a loyalty program.
- Will design some User Stories
- Answering What? Who? and Why?
** Design and implementation of a loyalty program in Ethereum
Will design with:
- Context diagram
- Sequence diagrams
** Design and implementation of a loyalty program in Waves
Will design with:
- Context diagram
- Sequence diagrams
** Selection of features
** Extraction of features
** Comparison of the features
* Experiment
** Creation of a loyalty program in Ethereum
** Creation of a loyalty program in Waves
** Analysis of a loyalty program developed in EOS
** Extracting features
* Results
* Discussions of results
  Only here it can have your personal opinions
* Conclusions and Lessons Learned
