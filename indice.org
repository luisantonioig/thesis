#+TITLE:Comparison between Smart Contracts Platforms
#+Author: Luis Ibarra
* TODO Introduction
** Definition of the problem
   There are too many  blockchain platform with different features implementing Smart Contracts and DApps.

   Developers do not know which one to use in each of citetheir projects

** Main Goal
To compare Smart Contracts Platforms to be able to recomend the best according with the purpose of the implementation

*** specific goals
- Implement Smart Contracts in different platforms
- Gather metrics
- Give a recomendation
** Scope and limitations
It will be implemented a loyalty program on Ethereum with Solidity and Golang, Python and Waves and will be analized a loyalty program made with EOS and C++

** Scope and limitations
Will be compared
- Cuantitative
  - Cost of transactions
  - Speed of transactions
  - Halstead complexity
- Cualitative
  - Easy to develop
  - Features
  - Consensus algorithm
  - Authentication methods
** Methodology
Will search about the 
** Contributions
- A comparison between Ethereum, Waves and EOS Smart Contracts platforms
- Implementation of a loyalty program on Ethereum (Solidity and Golang) and Waves (Python)
- Discussion about features in each platform
** How this thesis organized
- Background
- Methodology
- Experiment
- Results
- Discussion of the results
- Conclusion and Lessons Learned
- References
* TODO Background
** The importance of blockchain industry ($$)

** Mention some important bugs in history of smart contracts ($$)
 - The DAO Attack ($50)
 - King of the Ether Throne
 - Multi-player Games
 - Rubixi
 - GovernMental
 - Dynamic libraries
** Loyalty programs
*** History
- Airlines' frequent fliers schemes 1981
- Hotel's rewards
- Banks
- Grocery Stores
*** Size of the industry
- Membership has reached 1.3 billions (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
- The average US household belongs to 12 loyalty programs (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
- Only 4.7 yield active participation
** Blockchain Platforms
*** Bitcoin
*** Ethereum
*** Waves
*** Cardano
*** EOS
** Blockchain

*** History
- Bitcoin (2008) (Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system)
- Ethereum (2015)
- Fork: Ethereum and Ethereum Clasic (2016)
*** Consensus Algorithms
**** POW (Proof of Work)
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
**** POS (Proof of Stake)
**** Others
*** Smart Contracts
- Programming script inside the blockchain
- Executed autamatically
- Creation of DApps
*** Tokens
- Currencies created with Smart Contracts
- There are standars for creations of tokens like ERC-20
- Exist some exchanges (Waves)
- You can use wallets to save all your tokens
*** Decentralized applications
- Applications running inside the blockchain
- Distribuited
- Descentralized (This in red)
** Metrics
*** Quantitaive
- Cost
- Speed
- Halstead metrics
*** Qualititive
- Easy to develop
- Features
- Consensus algorithm
- Authentication methods

** Requirements Specification of a loyalty program.
- Will design some User Stories
- Answering What? Who? and Why?
** Design and implementation of a loyalty program in Ethereum
Will design with:
- Context diagram
- Sequence diagrams
** Design and implementation of a loyalty program in Waves
Will design with:
- Context diagram
- Sequence diagrams
** Selection of features
** Extraction of features
** TODO Comparison of the features
* TODO Experiment
** Creation of a loyalty program in Ethereum
** Creation of a loyalty program in Waves
** Analysis of a loyalty program developed in EOS
** Extracting features
* TODO Results
* TODO Discussions of results
  Only here it can have your personal opinions
* TODO Conclusions and Lessons Learned
