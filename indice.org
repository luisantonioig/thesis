#+TITLE:Comparison between Smart Contracts Platforms
#+Author: Luis Ibarra
* TODO Introduction
** Definition of the problem
There are too many  blockchain platform with different features implementing Smart Contracts and DApps.
Which blockchain is the best for my DApp?

** Main Goal
To compare Smart Contracts Platforms to be able to recomend the best according with the purpose of the implementation

*** specific goals
- To analyze the requirements, design and impement for a loyalty program to have a point of comparison between different smart contracts platforms.
- To identify the metrics used in decentralized applications to be compared, researching in the literature.
- To extract the metrics of each loyalty program implementation to compare each smart contract platform running all the implementations.

*** specific goals
- To identify the best smart contract platform to recommend it.
- To mention some of the characteristics and challenges of every implementation.
** Scope and limitations
It will be implemented a loyalty program on Ethereum with Solidity and Golang, Python and Waves and will be analized a loyalty program made with EOS and C++

** Scope and limitations
Will be compared
- Cuantitative
  - Cost of transactions
  - Speed of transactions
  - Halstead complexity
- Cualitative
  - Easy to develop
  - Features
  - Consensus algorithm
  - Authentication methods
** Methodology
- Analyze requirements, design and implement a loyalty program
- Identify 
** Contributions
- A comparison between Ethereum, Waves and EOS Smart Contracts platforms
- Implementation of a loyalty program on Ethereum (Solidity and Golang) and Waves (Python)
- Discussion about features in each platform
** How this thesis organized

- Methodology
- Experiment
- Results
- Discussion of the results
- Conclusion and Lessons Learned

** Mention some important bugs in history of smart contracts ($$)
 - The DAO Attack ($50)
 - King of the Ether Throne
 - Multi-player Games
 - Rubixi
 - GovernMental
 - Dynamic libraries
** Loyalty programs
*** History
- Airlines' frequent fliers schemes 1981
- Hotel's rewards
- Banks
- Grocery Stores
*** Size of the industry
- Membership has reached 1.3 billions (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
- The average US household belongs to 12 loyalty programs (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
- Only 4.7 yield active participation
** Blockchain Platforms
*** Bitcoin
*** Ethereum
*** Waves
*** Cardano
*** EOS

*** History
- Bitcoin (2008) (Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system)
- Ethereum (2015)
- Fork: Ethereum and Ethereum Clasic (2016)
*** Consensus Algorithms
**** POW (Proof of Work)
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
**** POS (Proof of Stake)
**** Others
*** Smart Contracts
- Programming script inside the blockchain
- Executed autamatically
- Creation of DApps
*** Tokens
- Currencies created with Smart Contracts
- There are standars for creations of tokens like ERC-20
- Exist some exchanges (Waves)
- You can use wallets to save all your tokens
*** Decentralized applications
- Applications running inside the blockchain
- Distribuited
- Descentralized (This in red)
** Metrics
*** Quantitaive
- Cost
- Speed
- Halstead metrics
*** Qualititive
- Easy to develop
- Features
- Consensus algorithm
- Authentication methods
