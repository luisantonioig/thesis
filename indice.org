#+Author: Luis Ibarra
* DONE Introduction
** Definition of the problem
There are too many  blockchain platform with different features implementing Smart Contracts and DApps.
Which blockchain is the best for my DApp?

** Main Goal
Compare Smart Contracts Platforms to be able to recomend the best according with the purpose of the application.

*** specific goals
- Analyze the requirements, design and impement for a loyalty program to have a point of comparison between different smart contracts platforms.
- Identify the metrics used in decentralized applications to be compared, researching in the literature.
- Extract the metrics of each loyalty program implementation to compare each smart contract platform running all the implementations.

** Scope and limitations
- It will be implemented a loyalty program on Ethereum and Waves with interaccion with the user from sms
- This work does not include a website or phone application
- We wont lauch this to the market
- It will be developed for just one developer, so it will be a bias

** Methodology
- Implementación de un programa base de un programa de recompensas en diferentes plataformas
- Recolectar métricas cuantitativas y cualitativas

** Contributions
- A comparison between Ethereum, Waves and EOS Smart Contracts platforms
- Implementation of a loyalty program on Ethereum and Waves
- Benchmarking about features in each platform

** How this thesis organized
- Background
- Methodology
- Experiment
- Results
- Discussion of the results
- Conclusion and Lessons Learned

** Loyalty programs
They are mechanisms to generate customer loyalty.
Basically, businnes reward the customer loyalty by giving products or services
*** History
- Airlines' frequent fliers schemes 1981
- Hotel's rewards
- Banks
- Grocery Stores
*** Size of the industry
- Membership has reached 1.3 billions (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
- The average US household belongs to 12 loyalty programs (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
- Only 4.7 yield active participation
** Blockchain
*** Definition

[[./blockchain.png]]

It is a network of nodes conected each other via peer-to-peer, every node in the network has an exact copy of the blockchain.

[[./block.png]]

Blocks saves the transactions of the users, and blocks are linked each other through the hash of the last block

*** The importance of blockchain industry
Blockchain allows to generate transaction of value between users, the value sent between users is called cryptocurrency.
Has been seen that capitalization in blockchain could be powerful.

*** History
- Bitcoin (2008) (Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system)
- Ethereum (2015)
- Fork: Ethereum and Ethereum Clasic (2016)
**** Bugs in history of smart contracts
   - The DAO Attack ($60) cite:luu2016making
   - King of the Ether Throne
   - Multi-player Games
   - Rubixi
   - GovernMental
   - Dynamic libraries

*** Consensus Algorithms
When a blockchain needs to insert a new node into the blockchain should be a consensus, this means, all nodes agree that the new block is correct.

There are some algorithms to archive consensus:
#+REVEAL: split
**** POW (Proof of Work)
In a proof of work algorithm, the node that insert the new block in the blockchain is called "miner", the miner selection process is done solving puzzles, the first node in solve the puzzle will add the new block.
Some of the blockchain platforms implementing proof of work algorithm are:
- Bitcoin
- Ethereum
#+REVEAL: split
**** POS (Proof of Stake)
In a Proof of Stake algorithm, participants have to stake some of cryptocurrency, the more cryptocurrency you stake the more probability of win you have
#+REVEAL: split
**** Others
There are others consensus algorithms, but they are algorithms based on Proof of Work and Proof of Stake
*** Smart Contracts

Smart Contracts are programming script inside the blockchain, they are used to simulate real world contracts in a blockchain
Smart Contracts can be Executed autamatically.
*** Tokens
:PROPERTIES:
    :reveal_background: ./bg_altcoins.png
    :reveal_background_trans: slide
    :END:
With Smart Contracts can be created new currencies called "tokens". Some blockchain platforms create tokens with standars (like ERC-20) to be compatible.
You can use Wallets in which you can save tokens and cryptocurrencies.
Also there are exchanges for tokens created by the blockchain users. (Waves)
*** Decentralized applications
You also can build "Decentralized applications" through Smart contracts.
Decentralized applications are applications running inside a blockchain.

** Blockchain Platforms
*** Bitcoin

In 2008, Nakamoto presented Bitcoin as a peer-to-peer cash system, so, users can send payments directly each other, Bitcoin uses blockchain technology.
As most of blockchain implementation, transactions in Bitcoin are validated by a consensus algorithm called Proof Of Work.
Bitcoin is known as: cryptocurrency, system of transactions and blockchain
Bitcoin as a currency can have a price, this price can   
*** Ethereum

    :END:
Such as Bitcoin, Ethereum is an implementation of blockchain concepts, but, it implement Smart Contracts.
Users in Ethereum can create and run Smart Contracts inside, they run in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
EVM could be compared with a backend of a Web application. 
*** Waves

Waves is a decentralized blockchain focusing on custom blockchain tokens operations (Waves white paper)
Waves has a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and a easy way to create tokens
Leased Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) is a consensus algorithm used for Waves
*** Cardano

Cardano is presented as the first blockchain implementing Proof-of-Stake consensus algorithm, this protocol is more efficient than Proof-of-Stake because it needs less computing power.
Cardano uses two ways to create and run Smart Contracts and Descentralized Applications; Plutus (a functional programming language based on haskell), and Marlowe (an intuitive platform for developing Smart contracts)
*** Cardano
General and small modules (among others) are Benefits of Plutus (a functional programming language) (Cite Why functional programming matters)

EOS is a blockchain platform that can scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees and allows for quick and easy deployment and maintenance of decentralized applications. Cite eos technical paper
