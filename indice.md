# Background


## Loyalty programs


### History

-   Airlines' frequent fliers schemes 1981
-   Hotel's rewards
-   Banks
-   Grocery Stores


### Size of the industry

-   Membership has reached 1.3 billions (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
-   The average US household belongs to 12 loyalty programs (The COLLOQUY loyalty marketing census: sizing up the US loyalty marketing industry)
-   Only 4.7 yield active participation


## Blockchain


### Definition

![img](./blockchain.png)
![img](./block.png)


### History

-   Bitcoin (2008) (Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer electronic cash system)
-   Ethereum (2015)
-   Fork: Ethereum and Ethereum Clasic (2016)


### Consensus Algorithms

1.  POW (Proof of Work)

    -   Bitcoin
    -   Ethereum

2.  POS (Proof of Stake)

3.  Others


### Smart Contracts

-   Programming script inside the blockchain
-   Executed autamatically
-   Creation of DApps


### Tokens

-   Currencies created with Smart Contracts
-   There are standars for creations of tokens like ERC-20
-   Exist some exchanges (Waves)
-   You can use wallets to save all your tokens


### Decentralized applications

-   Applications running inside the blockchain
-   Distribuited
-   Descentralized (This in red)


## Technologies


### Bitcoin


### Ethereum


### Waves


### Cardano


### EOS


## Metrics


### Quantitaive

-   Cost
-   Speed
-   Halstead metrics


### Qualititive

-   Easy to develop
-   Features
-   Consensus algorithm
-   Authentication methods


# Methodology
